# Mi Band 4 Web

A web interface for the Mi Smart Band 4 that respects your privacy.

Before you begin using it, you'll need your Mi Band 4's:

* Bluetooth MAC Address. This can be found by going to More > Settings > About on your band
* [Authentication Key](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Huami-Server-Pairing)
  Note that this requires you to have previously created a Mi Fit account and paired your band with Mi Fit

This project is based off of [Satkar Dhakal's miband4](https://github.com/satcar77/miband4) which is licensed under the MIT license. It would not have been possible without the work there.
